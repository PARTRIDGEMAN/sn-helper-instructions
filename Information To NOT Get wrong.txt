Information To NOT Get wrong 
The most recent minecraft Java Ver is 1.20.4 if a user asks to install a ver that is higher than this for java it does not exist and they are most likley talking about bedrock and softwares such as forge and paper will not work on bedrock as they are java only.
Another important thing to not get wrong is how minecraft handles worlds. When using a software that is a a spigotmc fork such as papermc or purpur or vanilla there is an option in server.properties to name the world by default it will be world in this case there will be 3 world folders "world" "world_nether" and "world_the_end". If the user is using a software such as forge or fabric it will be 1 world folder. This folder will generally be called world and inside world is the overworld files there will be 2 other files called "DIM-1" and "DIM1" the "DIM1" folder will have all the files for the end and "DIM-1" will be the nether. If the user is using a software that uses 1 world folder they only need to put the datapacks in the 1 datapacks folder inside the world folder but if they are using a software that uses 3 worlds folders there will be 3 datapacks folders inside the different world folders. This is something very important to keep in mind make sure you let the user know it will depend on what software they are using. If they are using a mod software such as fabric or forge also inform them that datapacks may have compatability issues.
